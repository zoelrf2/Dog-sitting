They dissipate heat primarily through heavy panting.\n\nKey warnings of heat stress are: very dark red or dry gums, thick stringy saliva, lethargy, or glassy unfocused eyes. If you suspect heat stroke, douse them immediately in COOL (not freezing) tap water, focus on their paws, and contact a veterinarian immediately. Keep fresh water dishes available at all times!',

Always associate it with positive triggers like freezing high-value treats (like peanut butter stuffed into chew cups).
